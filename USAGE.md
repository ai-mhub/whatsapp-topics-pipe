## Troubleshooting

**"No WhatsApp data found"**
- Ensure WhatsApp Web is open and logged in
- Check that screenpipe is capturing your screen
- Try increasing the capture time window

**"Topics not being extracted"**

- Check the browser URL includes "web.whatsapp.com"
- Ensure messages are visible on screen during capture

**"Missing important topics"**
- Lower the minimum importance score in settings
- Add specific keywords to your search
- Check if sender filters are too restrictive
